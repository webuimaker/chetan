Reshaping though frequently required in data analysis, so often it remains confusing even if you are frequent user of `reshape` function. Here I have provided an simple example to elaborate more on each argument of `reshape`.

## Reshape data from wide to long


Your data in wide form if the multiple observations of item, place or person (i.e. units) has been recorded in single row (but in multiple column). This multiple observations may be of repeated measure type (observation are made repeatedly at different time point) or multiple characteristics of some unit (eg. height, length and width of square). 

Let's take an example of wide data of repeated measure type. Person A is visiting clinic every month for their blood pressure check, and nurse note down the value for each month in single row which belong to this specific person A. See example below,


```{r}
# wide data
df <- data.frame(matrix(data = NA, nrow = 3, ncol = 5, dimnames = list(NULL, paste0(c("id","name","jan","feb","march")))))
df[1,] <- c(1,"A",123,120,125)
df[2,] <- c(2,"B",140,150,155)
df[3,] <- c(3,"C",96,86,97)
```
 
Our "wide" data look like

```{r}
knitr::kable(df, caption = "wide data")
```

We want a data in which each new observation in new row but within same column i.e. long data. To achieve that we need to use standard `reshape` command in `R`. The `reshape` has following argument:

+ `idvar` : unique identifier for person,place or object on which observations(measurements) are made at different time points or repeatedly. Example `Case ID`

+ `varying` :  if observation for specific individuals are made at different time points, in which columns values are recorded i.e time-varying columns. Example `Jan`, `Feb`, `March`

+ `timevar`: what will be the name of column once the time-varying columns above has been staked in rows. Example `Month` 

+ `times` : what will be the values (of time) once the time-varying columns above has been staked in rows. Example  `Jan`, `Feb`, `March`

+ `v.names`: what will be the values (of observations) once the time-varying columns above has been staked in rows. Example `BP`

+ `direction`: data needs to converted from wide to `long` format.


```{r}
df_long <- reshape(df,
idvar = "id",  
        #[unique identifier for person,place or object on which observations(measurments) are made at different time points or repeatedly]

varying = c("jan","feb","march"),  
        # [if observation for specific individulas are made at different time points, in which columns values are recorded i.e time-varying columns ]

timevar = "month", 
        # [what will be the name of column once the timevarying columns above has been staked in rows]

times = c("jan","feb","march"),
        # [what will be the values (of time) once the timevarying columns above has been staked in rows]

v.names = "BP", 
        # [what will be the values (of observations) once the timevarying columns above has been staked in rows]

direction = "long")   
        # [we want to convert wide df into long one])
```

Our "long" data look like

```{r echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
df_long <- arrange(df_long, id)

kable(df_long,format = "pandoc", caption = "long data")
```

Sometime, not only one type of measurement (BP) but also other types (such as heart rate-HR) are measured and recorded row wise. For example,

```{r}
# wide data
df <- data.frame(matrix(data = NA, nrow = 3, ncol = 8, dimnames = list(NULL, paste0(c("id","name","BP_jan","BP_feb","BP_march","HR_jan","HR_feb","HR_march")))))
df[1,] <- c(1,"A",123,120,125,72,70,71)
df[2,] <- c(2,"B",140,150,155,85,82,86)
df[3,] <- c(3,"C",96,86,97,65,52,59)
```

```{r}
kable(df,format = "pandoc", caption = "wide data- multiple category")
```

This data can be converted into "long" by using `list` for group of time-varying columns for `varying`


```{r}
df_long <- reshape(df,
idvar = "id",  
varying = list(c("BP_jan","BP_feb","BP_march"),c("HR_jan","HR_feb","HR_march") ),  
timevar = "month", 
times = c("jan","feb","march"),
v.names = c("BP","HR"), 
direction = "long")   
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
df_long <- arrange(df_long, id)
kable(df_long,format = "pandoc", caption = "long data")
```


## Reshape data from long to wide

To make data "wide" from long, the `reshape` function will need only two main arguments

+ `idvar`: unique identifier of unit on which measurement are made

+ `timevar` : which column represent **the timing** of the observations ( so that `reshape` function associate it with the value for given time for each ID )

If you do not specify above two arguments, function will drop an error-  

`Error in [.data.frame (data, , idvar) : undefined columns selected`

If you read above error carefully, it already specifying  which arguments were missing. Here in above case missing argument was `idvar`.


You can optionally provide,  

+ `v.names` : which column represent **values** of the observations in long data (so that `reshape` function can transform these values into rows for each ID)

+ `sep`: column names in wide format are going to be created using value of `timesvar` and `integers`. Specify how both will be seperated in column names.

Here is the example

```{r}
df_wide <- reshape(df_long,
       idvar = "id",
       # unique identifier
       timevar = "month",
       # the column represent the timing of the observations
       v.names = c("BP","HR"),
       # the columns represent the value of the observation (BP,HR)
       direction = "wide",
       sep = "_"
        )
```

Here is the wide data

```{r echo=FALSE}
kable(df_wide,format = "pandoc", caption = "wide data")
```
