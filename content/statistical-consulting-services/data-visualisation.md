## Transform Your Data into Comprehensible and Intelligent Insights with Data Visualisation  
<br />
<br />


> The descriptive statistics and statistical analysis are essential to summarise the relationship in the data, but it is also equally important to present the findings visually and make them comprehensible for a non-technical audience. Data visualisation helps decision-makers understand their data quickly and effectively without digging into complext statistical analysis.

Data visualisation is a graphical tool that presents complex numerical information in a visual form that enhances our understating of the data and highlights trends, patterns, and relationships. It is a way to present large, complex data in a clear, accessible manner in order to develop better insight. Effective data visualisation tells a story, conveys the right message in the best and simplest form.

## How ISCON statistician can help you to create precise and efficient visualisation  so that it has the right impact

We have been offering top-notch data visualization services for researchers and businesses. We think that data visualization is a key part of any data analytics. This is because it allows you to immediately spot any trends, easily identify outliers, track goal achievement, and compare the performance of various categories, brands, and products, etc. At ISCON Statistics, we understand the goals of data visualisation. We leverage our expertise and advanced data visualisation software (such as Plotly, GGplot2 in R, D3.js ) to present big data in an easily understandable and visually appealing format. We ensure precise and efficient representation of data so that it has the right impact. We can transform data into compelling experiences, meaningful stories, powerful and valuable insights, and unique tools. We are also proficient in interactive data visualisation. Interactive data visualisation empowers users who do not have knowledge of advanced statistics. These users can explore, manipulate, and interact with graphics solely by simply clicking a mouse button. Users can also change the variables, type of graph, and colour of graphics, etc. allowing for in-depth exploration.

## Characteristics of effective data visualisation

Effective data visualisation helps uncover trends and patterns from the data without distorting the data. Effective data visualisation also communicates findings clearly and effectively, highlighting important patterns and relationships. It also helps the audience understand difficult concepts easily and quickly.
Edward Tufte, a prominent statistician, explained the characteristics of “ideal” data visualisation in his book “The Visual Display of Quantitative Information.” According to Tufte, data visualisation should have a clear purpose, should reveal several layers of details without distorting the facts, and should closely align with the statistical findings.
Our skilled experts and specialists leverage their knowledge and experience to combine creative analytics with amazing reporting tools in order to develop and maintain robust relationships.

## Interactive data visualisations

Interactive data visualisations allow users to change the components of graphics interchangeably on screen, allowing a greater understanding of the data. The usage of interactive data visualisations is now increasing because of ease of use and interactivity with real-time data.
Interactive data visualisations also offer real-time access to data sources, making it invaluable in creating interactive dashboard- where information from a variety of sources are gathered and visually available in one screen.

ISCON statisticians are experienced in creating interactive dashboards and graphics using a variety of platforms, such as Plotly, R shiny, and ggplot2. Contact us now to develop interactive data visualisation or dashboard at an affordable cost. 

## Quality figures for research publication

Publishing your research in scientific journals requires that you have high-quality figures. It is important to derive figures with utmost care and diligence because these figures- being visual elements - are the only medium to convey your research findings clearly and most appealing to the scientific community.

Reliable figures bridge the gap between human cognition and numbers. They should be free from “chart-junk” (the word coined by Edward Tufte), which are unnecessary and confusing elements in figure, such as labels, gridlines, and background. It should have a detailed caption, explaining more details about the figure in a similar way you explain the figure to your audience while giving a presentation. It also has efficient use of colour, and highlights an important message.
