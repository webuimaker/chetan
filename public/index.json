[{"categories":null,"contents":" Designing of research study should be given more attention than on data collection and analysis. It is difficult to re-do the poorly designed study but you can always re-analyse data with different method. Therefore, it cannot be stressed enough that best time to contact ISCON statistician is before designing your research study.\n The studies with poor planning i.e. vague research questions, unclear hypothesis, inadequate sample size, inappropriate choice of variables, improper randomisation, poor follow up are deemed to produce inaccurate and meaningless results. Statistician at ISCON Statistics can be your best companion help every steps of your research project – starting from research idea to development of study protocol to successful completion and reporting in high-impact journals. Our statistician can help you with-\n Formulating research questions and research hypothesis and develop statistical analysis plan Defining and clarifying the study outcomes- primary outcome, secondary outcome, data collection methods and frequency of the measurements Advice you about study design whether it’s appropriate to answer research questions or hypothesis Discuss with you the impact of bias, randomisation, allocation and blinding on results Discuss with you the required sample size (so study has optimum statistical power) in different conditions/hypothesis Help you to develop study protocol, statistical analysis plan, any secondary or interim analysis.  Help translating your research idea into a statistically answerable question In planning research study, it very important to formulate research question that is clear, specific and well defined. Because, it is your question that will determine the conduct of the study and method of statistical analysis. It is your research question that will guide the development of the study protocol, sample size estimation and power calculation. Well defined research questions have three essential characteristics. First, the research question should describe or hypothesize the relationship between two or more variables. Second, it should take the form of question and third, the variables in proposed questions must allowed to be observed or measured through either observation or by experiments. A vague research question not only leads to complexity of both data collection and subsequent statistical analyses but also indirectly affects reliability of the proposed study. The specific and clear research questions help statistician determining the sample size, power and method of the analysis - producing valid and meaningful results of your study. ISCON Statistics will. ISCON recommends PICO format to develop specific research question: Population of interest, the Intervention being studied, the Comparison group (or to what is the intervention being compared) and the Outcome of interest.\nLet us help you to derive clear research question from your research topic so that your research project conduct smoothly- drawing meaningful and accurate conclusion.\nHelp in articulating specific research hypothesis that drives your statistical analysis Your research question helps you to articulate specific research hypotheses. Hypothesis is basically a statement – a educated guess about potential relationship between two or more variables. Formulating a clear research hypothesis based on specific research question drives the smooth conduct of the study ultimately leads to valid data analysis. Only after research hypothesis being formulated, data will be collected and then tested statistically whether to reject or not to reject hypothesis, based on observed sample data. The research question and hypothesis need to be formulated before the start of the study, not after data being collected. It a research questions that should determine the hypothesis, not the observed data. Retrospectively formulating hypothesis from observed data carries risk of multiple statistical testing which than leads to declaring dubious statistical association.\nIn statistics, hypothesis can be null and alternative hypothesis. The null hypothesis states that there is no association, difference or correlation between two or more variable whereas alternative hypothesis states that there is association, difference or correlation. The statistical test or model than test this hypothesis whether to reject of the hypothesis. Hypothesis can be directional (one sided) or non-directional (two sided). In directional hypothesis, one has to specify not only the association but also direction of association-difference or correlation (how much greater, lesser or better or worse) in hypothesis statement.\nFrom your research idea, we help you to set clear research questions and formulate testable research hypothesis.\nHelping you choosing right variables for your research Variable is a characteristic that varies from person by person or item by item, i.e. takes different value in different person, item or thing. There are thousands of variables can be measured and reported in research literature, the question is which variables to choose and which to discard, if chosen too many, how it would be included in statistical analysis.\nVariables can be dependent or independent. The dependent variable is the variable which values are dependent on other variables- which are called independent variables. We are interested in assessing the effects of the independent variables on dependent variable (outcome). The better nomenclature would be - response variable and explanatory variables. We are interested is how explanatory variables (independent variables) explains the variation in response variable i.e. outcome (dependent variable).\nThe choice and number of variables in your study depends on multiple factors. It depends on your study objective- whether you are interested in specific phenomenon (limited numbers) or identifying important variables from collecting large number of variables (through specialized statistical methods). It also dependent on your subject specific knowledge – include variables that are important in a way that are associated with outcome and/or explanatory variables or both (known as confounding variable). Omitting or not handling confounding variables appropriately in statistical analysis often leads to biased and inaccurate conclusion. ISCON Statistician can help you to choose optimum number of variables and analyse your study with best possible methods getting you valid and unbiased statistical results.\nHelp in calculating sample size required in your research study so that your study has optimum statistical power Sample size is number of participants needed in the study to answer research questions. The aim of sample size determination is to calculate number of samples required in study in order to detect important, meaningful effect. We needed to calculate this number with great precision because if the sample size is too small, we many not be able to detect an important effect, whereas unnecessarily large sample size leads to waste of resources. So, it is so vital to optimize the sample size during planning phase as you want to make sure that effort you are making in research study is worthwhile i.e. should leads to valid and meaningful conclusion. It is also ethically undesirable to expose more participants than needed from side effect, toxicity of drug or intervention. Therefore, majority of ethics committee always ask about the optimum sample size in your research study before they give you approval.\nIn order to determine correct the sample size, you need to have clear research question, set of clear study hypothesis, details about your outcome variable, its variability and expected/predicted change in your outcome in your study. Specifically, you need to have details about four main items (1) the extent at which you want to have false positive results in your study (alpha which type 1 error rate, most commonly 5%) (2) probability that you want to detect the effect when it really exist (statistical power, commonly 80%) (3) smallest difference that clinically meaningful i.e. effect that you don’t want to miss, also known as minimal clinically significant difference(MCSD) and last (4) variability of outcome in population in which you going get sample (which you can gather from previously published studies).\nThe formula and method of sample size determination dependent many factors such as - study objectives, number of hypothesis, type of outcome (continuous, binary, time to event, count), number of group or explanatory variables in your study, type of your study design (observational or experimental study, parallel group clinical trial, cross-over trial, cluster or adaptive trials), method of statistical analysis (simple statistical test or advanced statistical models with covariates included such as liner mixed model with clustering) and resources (funding source, recruitment rate, staff availability, timelines).\nIts is prudent to ask statistician to calculate optimum sample size because the complexity involves in methods and scenarios and secondly, statistician may have expert knowledge of other efficient, specialized method (such as Monte Carlo simulation) than formulas which can establish optimum number of samples robustly. ISCON Statisticians particularly experienced in calculating and explaining the sample size calculation in different scenarios in wide variety of study designs and statistical methods.

Data visualisation helps decision-makers understand their data quickly and effectively without digging into complext statistical analysis.\n Data visualisation is a graphical tool that presents complex numerical information in a visual form that enhances our understating of the data and highlights trends, patterns, and relationships. It is a way to present large, complex data in a clear, accessible manner in order to develop better insight. Effective data visualisation tells a story, conveys the right message in the best and simplest form.\nHow ISCON statistician can help you to create precise and efficient visualisation so that it has the right impact We have been offering top-notch data visualization services for researchers and businesses. We think that data visualization is a key part of any data analytics. This is because it allows you to immediately spot any trends, easily identify outliers, track goal achievement, and compare the performance of various categories, brands, and products, etc. At ISCON Statistics, we understand the goals of data visualisation. We leverage our expertise and advanced data visualisation software (such as Plotly, GGplot2 in R, D3.js ) to present big data in an easily understandable and visually appealing format. We ensure precise and efficient representation of data so that it has the right impact. We can transform data into compelling experiences, meaningful stories, powerful and valuable insights, and unique tools. We are also proficient in interactive data visualisation. Interactive data visualisation empowers users who do not have knowledge of advanced statistics. These users can explore, manipulate, and interact with graphics solely by simply clicking a mouse button. Users can also change the variables, type of graph, and colour of graphics, etc. allowing for in-depth exploration.\nCharacteristics of effective data visualisation Effective data visualisation helps uncover trends and patterns from the data without distorting the data. Effective data visualisation also communicates findings clearly and effectively, highlighting important patterns and relationships. It also helps the audience understand difficult concepts easily and quickly. Edward Tufte, a prominent statistician, explained the characteristics of “ideal” data visualisation in his book “The Visual Display of Quantitative Information.” According to Tufte, data visualisation should have a clear purpose, should reveal several layers of details without distorting the facts, and should closely align with the statistical findings. Our skilled experts and specialists leverage their knowledge and experience to combine creative analytics with amazing reporting tools in order to develop and maintain robust relationships.\nInteractive data visualisations Interactive data visualisations allow users to change the components of graphics interchangeably on screen, allowing a greater understanding of the data. The usage of interactive data visualisations is now increasing because of ease of use and interactivity with real-time data. Interactive data visualisations also offer real-time access to data sources, making it invaluable in creating interactive dashboard- where information from a variety of sources are gathered and visually available in one screen.\nISCON statisticians are experienced in creating interactive dashboards and graphics using a variety of platforms, such as Plotly, R shiny, and ggplot2. Contact us now to develop interactive data visualisation or dashboard at an affordable cost.\nQuality figures for research publication Publishing your research in scientific journals requires that you have high-quality figures. It is important to derive figures with utmost care and diligence because these figures- being visual elements - are the only medium to convey your research findings clearly and most appealing to the scientific community.\nReliable figures bridge the gap between human cognition and numbers. They should be free from “chart-junk” (the word coined by Edward Tufte), which are unnecessary and confusing elements in figure, such as labels, gridlines, and background. It should have a detailed caption, explaining more details about the figure in a similar way you explain the figure to your audience while giving a presentation. It also has efficient use of colour, and highlights an important message.\nBenefits of our data visualisation services Improved data insights By taking our data visualisation services, you can significantly improve data insights, which is not possible with traditional descriptive statistical methods.\nConcise and effective data visualisation Our experienced professionals know how to develop data visuals that give you a complete picture of your data. Through our interactive visualisations, you can correlate, decipher, and connect critical data information to make informed decisions.\nMultiplatform compatibility We understand that you might need to access your data visuals through multiple platforms. Therefore, we create data visualisations that remain effective across multiple platforms without losing relevance.\nCustomizable services As an experienced statistical analysis services provider, we offer customizable data visualisation services based on your specific requirements.\nTransform charts and spreadsheets If your data is present in traditional formats like charts and spreadsheets, our experts can convert it into easily understandable and visually pleasing visuals. This not only infuses life into your complex data but also enhances its meaningfulness.\nThere are multiple ways you can convey your research findings accurately in the form of figures in scientific publications. Let ISCON Statistics help you produce figures that are clear, accurate, and convey all the relevant information in a meaningful way.

Statistics is not only about collecting data and creating graphs and tables; it is a science of making inferences or predictions from observed data applied to a population. Precisely, statistics is a branch of science that deals with the collection, organisation, and analysis of data to draw inferences from the samples and apply them to the whole population. Variability is inherent in a population, process, or phenomenon. Statisticians value this variation and use it efficiently to make inferences or predictions about the population.\nMake stronger and smarter decisions faster\nAt ISCON Statistics, we offer robust statistical analysis and data modelling services.

This helps you in improving the implications of your study outcomes and maximizes effectiveness.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s collaborate to help you overcome your data analysis and modelling challenges!\nDescriptive statistics and inferential statistics Descriptive statistics and inferential statistics are the two main branches of statistical science. Before we go into details about the difference between two, let us explain some basic concepts (with examples below), which will help you understand statistical analysis in more detail.\n Experiment: A scientific procedure undertaken to make a discovery or test a hypothesis Sampling Method: Random sampling from a population to ensure the validity of inference and conclusion Sample Data: A record of the observed quantity of variables of interest in a sample population Sample Statistic: The quantity of interest– mean, median, and the standard deviation in sample data Sampling Distribution Of Sample Statistic: Distribution of sample statistic on hypothetical random sampling Population Parameter: The true value of the variable interest in population which is unknown Standard Error: Variability of sample statistic on repeated sampling - standard deviation of sample statistic in the sampling distribution Confidence Interval: A statement about the true value of the population parameter lies in some interval with some degree of confidence  Lets take an example to understand above concepts. We want to know the average weight of the babies born in the UK (experiment); we cannot go to each hospital in the UK and weigh each baby (population). We need to choose a few which are representative of the population. Therefore, we need to have a list of all of the hospitals in the UK (sampling frame) and choose a few of them randomly (simple random sampling) and weigh each baby being born in the hospital (sample population). We will note down each baby’s weight (sample data) and calculate the mean (sample statistic). We will go to other hospitals, record the data, and calculate the mean. We will continue this process until we get the data from 100 hospitals. If we have sample data from 100 hospitals, we have a total 100 mean of the baby weight. However, each mean will not be the same because of random variation (sampling variability). If we plot the 100 mean of sample data, there will be some form of distribution (sampling distribution of sample statistic). The standard deviation of sample means in this distribution will be the standard error (standard error). If we truly had a random sample, the mean of the sampling distribution will be the true mean (population parameter), which is the average weight of the baby in the UK.\nDescriptive Statistics Descriptive statistics is concerned with describing the nature of observed data by some quantity that summarizes the data. These quantities can be measures of central tendency (location) and measures of variability (spread). Measures of central tendency are the mean, median, and mode, and measures of variability, such as the standard deviation, variance, the maximum and minimum values of the variable, and the skewness and kurtosis.\n ISCON Statistician can help you get the best results from your descriptive statistics projects by interpreting the findings of your research as well as presenting your statistics.\n Inferential statistics Inferential statistics is concerned with understanding something that is unobserved in the wider population. Statistical inference aims to estimate the uncertainty in hypothetical repeated sampling. This uncertainty will allow us to provide a plausible range of values for the true value of something in the population, such as the mean, and it allows us to make statements about plausibility in terms of the degree of confidence. All statistical inferences involve some form of a statistical model.\n","permalink":"/statistical-consulting-services/statistical-analysis-modelling/","tags":null,"title":"Statistical Analysis \u0026 Modelling"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Why You Need Professional Dissertation Statistical Consulting Services As a post-graduate or PhD student, you must do research related to your field of study.

Our statistician build model in both, observed data and on data with multiple imputation of missing observations using MICE (multiple imputation with chain equations). To find predictive ability of the factors, ROC (Receiver Operating Curve) analysis has been performed.\nOutcome: The project completed on time with detailed report explaining statistical methods and findings in non-technical language. Multivariate model after missing data imputation (under MAR assumption of missingness) provided an evidence that BMI and FEV1 are important predictors of events of Asthma exacerbation. 1 unit increase in BMI found to be associated with 4% increased risk of Asthma exacerbation (95% CI 1%,8%, P 0.01) and patient with high FEV1 has lower risk of events. 1 unit increase in FEV1 values found to reduce the risk by 1% (95% CI 0.3,2%, P 0.007).
